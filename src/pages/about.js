                Welcome to my online portfolio.

              <p>A little of history about me...</p>

              <p>
                I was born in Argentina, but I have lived in Chile for most of
                my life. I studied business engineering and after a short time
                working, I travel to Australia on a working holiday visa. While
                i was in Australia I met my wife. We lived in Australia for two
                years.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2021 while I was living in England with my wife, I decided to
                make a have a change of career and started studying programming.
                Specifically Frontend Developing.
              </p>
              <p>I'm currently living in Leigh on Sea, England.</p>

              <p>
                I am keen to develop my skills within a professional role. I am
                looking to obtain a role within a fast paced and progressive
                environment; that will develop my Frontend knowledge and further
                benefit myself and an organisation.
