              <p>A little of history about me...</p>

              <p>
                I was born in Argentina, but I have lived in Chile for most of
                my life. I studied business engineering and after a short time
                working, I travel to Australia on a working holiday visa. During
                my time in Australia I met my wife, where we lived in Melbourne
                for two years.
              </p>

              <p>
                I am currently living in Leigh on Sea, England. Hoping to obtain
                an entry-level position at a great company to be a hard-working
                asset to any team, to learn, grow and develop long-term.
              </p>
              <p>I hold a valid settlement visa, no sponsorship is required.</p>
