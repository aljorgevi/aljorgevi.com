              <p>A little of history about me...</p>

              <p>
                I was born in Argentina, but I have lived in Chile for most of
                my life. I studied business engineering and after a short time
                working, I travelled to Australia on a working holiday visa.
                During my time in Australia I met my wife, where we lived in
                Melbourne for two years.
              </p>

              <p>
                I am currently living in Leigh on Sea, England. Driven and
                motivated to achieve success as a qualified professional
                software developer.
